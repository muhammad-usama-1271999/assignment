//Question 6: striping names, and include some whitespace characters in beginning and end of the name. use "\t" (tab) and "\n"(new line) at least once,
//print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the whitespace.

let myName: string = "\n\t Muhammad Usama\t\n";

console.log(myName);//white space print out

console.log("Date of birth 12-2-1999");//without white space print
let friendName: string = "mazahir";
console.log(friendName.trim());
